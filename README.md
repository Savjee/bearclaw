## Known issue's

* Screenshots aren't always saved by Bear. This happens when you repeatedly make screenshots. No idea why this happens, could be an issue with Bear's x-callback-url.


## Contributing
I quickly hacked this app together. I'm also not a Swift developer so I can definitely use some help!

Feel free to open issue's and pull requests!
